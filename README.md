# -ANM_655_01-Scripting-for-VFX-and-Riggers
This repository is used to organize my learning notes, experiments, and thought process while studying scripting for VFX and rigging.

Most files here are created alongside coursework, focusing on understanding *why* things work rather than just making them work. I use this space to stack my thinking step by step: trying ideas, breaking things, fixing them, and gradually building intuition about scripting workflows used in VFX and rigging.

If you are taking the same class or working on similar assignments, I hope some of these notes or examples can help you understand the problems more easily or inspire a different way to approach them. Feel free to reference, learn from, or adapt them for your own study.
